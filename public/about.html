<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Jason Smith and I'm a junior developer.  I have an AS degree in computer programming and a Bachelor's of Science 
    in Computer Information Systems Technology.
  </p>

  <p>While my formal education has provided me with business management skills, a better understanding of professional communication, 
    and the basics of professional programming, it's been my own dedication to developing my skills that has led me here.  I took it 
    upon myself to learn front- and back-end development, as these were specific skills not covered by my Associate's or Bachelor's 
    degrees and I wanted something more than a degree to show what I can do.

    remove it.
